Building the Tool

   The cmd5 tool can be created using a simple "make":
    make


Usage

   The cmd5 tool calculates the CRAM-MD5 digest for SMTP-AUTH. It is
   invoked as follows:
    ./cmd5 <username> <password> <challenge>


   The challenge is Base64 encoded, as returned by the server.

Sample Session

   A sample session with an smtp server looks as follows: (lines marked
   with "*" are entered by the client)
      220 caraz.net-track.ch ESMTP
    * EHLO client
      250-caraz.net-track.ch
      250-AUTH LOGIN CRAM-MD5 PLAIN
      250-AUTH=LOGIN CRAM-MD5 PLAIN
      250-PIPELINING
      250 8BITMIME
    * AUTH CRAM-MD5


   Here, the server will output the Base64-encoded challenge:
      334 PDMyLjEzMjM0MTIzQG1haWxob3N0Pg==


   This challenge can now be used by cmd5 as follows:
    ./cmd5 foo@baar PaZZword PDMyLjEzMjM0MTIzQG1haWxob3N0Pg==
    :
    :
    base64 encoded: Zm9vQGJhYXIgM2I4YTc4ODZkNGYxNzFhNDIxMWZlODU5NDQ0MWZjZmI=


   This result can now be entered into the SMTP server conversation:
    * Zm9vQGJhYXIgM2I4YTc4ODZkNGYxNzFhNDIxMWZlODU5NDQ0MWZjZmI=


   If the username and password is correct, the user is now
   authenticated.
